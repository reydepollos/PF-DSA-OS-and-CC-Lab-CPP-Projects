## Overview
This repository contains a collection of C++ lab projects developed during university courses. The projects focus on four main areas: Programming Fundamentals, Data Structures, Operating Systems, and Compiler Construction. Each project demonstrates key concepts and problem-solving techniques relevant to these subjects.

You can find the latest releases of the projects [here](https://github.com/reydepollos/PF-DSA-OS-and-CC-Lab-CPP-Projects/releases). Download and execute the files to explore the implementations.

## Projects
1. **Programming Fundamentals**
   - Basic syntax and structure of C++
   - Control structures (if, loops)
   - Functions and scope

2. **Data Structures**
   - Arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues
   - Trees and graphs
   - Sorting and searching algorithms

3. **Operating Systems**
   - Process management
   - Memory management
   - File systems and I/O operations

4. **Compiler Construction**
   - Lexical analysis
   - Syntax analysis
   - Semantic analysis and code generation

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: The primary programming language for all projects.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes.
- **Makefile**: For building and managing project dependencies.
- **GDB**: Debugging tool for C++ applications.

## Getting Started
To get started with the projects, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reydepollos/PF-DSA-OS-and-CC-Lab-CPP-Projects.git
   cd PF-DSA-OS-and-CC-Lab-CPP-Projects
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. You can use g++ or any other compatible compiler.

3. **Build the Projects**
   Navigate to the specific project directory and run:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. **Run the Executable**
   After building, execute the program:
   ```bash
   ./project_executable_name
   ```
